For my Bachelor's dissertation project I created an Android game development framework with minimal library support. One of my main aims with the project was to learn the mathematical models and formulae behind the different systems in games, and potentially discover new methods for applying these algorithmically.

The full report PDF can be found in the repository, however some of the areas I looked into are:

* Collision detection & resolution
* AI pathfinding & behaviour
* Creating a game prototype based off the framework
